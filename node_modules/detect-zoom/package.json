  "readme": "Cross Browser Zoom and Pixel Ratio Detector\n======\n------\n\n\n### Known issues:\n* In Firefox on retina displays (Macbook Pros), the base zoom level is always 2.0. I'm aware of it and looking for a solution.\n* Some desktop input devices like Wacom tablets add \"mobile like\" touch events which break the feature detection I'm using and gives false zoom level results. Working on a better way to detect these.\n* In some multi-monitor enviroments where each monitor has a different 'pixel aspect ratio' windows that span accross both monitors might return false pixelAspectRatio values.\n\nWhat is this for?\n------\nDetecting the browser zoom level and device pixel ratio relative to the zoom level.\n\nIt can be used to show higher-resolution `canvas` or `img` when necessary,\nto warn users that your site's layout will be broken in their current zoom level,\nand much more.\nPersonally I'm maintaining it to use Detect-zoom in [Wix.com](http://wix.com)'s editor to warn users\nthat their browser is in zoom mode before saving important changes to their website.\n\nWhat happend to @yonran?\n------\nDon't worry, he is well.\nAs of January 2013 [@yonran](https://github.com/yonran) stopped maintaining his source of detect-zoom, and transferred the repository to me.\nIf you are looking to update previous versions note that there were some breaking changes\n\n* **Major Changes from the latest yonran version:**\n    * `DetectZoom` object name changed to `detectZoom`\n    * `DetectZoom.ratio()` is no longer publicly accessible\n    * Supported browsers: IE8+, FF4+, modern Webkit, mobile Webkit, Opera 11.1+\n    * *IE6, IE7, FF 3.6 and Opera 10.x are no longer supported*\n    * Added support to be loaded as an AMD and CommonJS module\n\nLive Example\n------\nSee the Live Example section in\nhttp://tombigel.github.com/detect-zoom/\n\nUsage\n------\n**Detect-zoom has only two public functions:**\n* `zoom()`   Returns the zoom level of the user's browser using Javascript.\n* `device()`   Returns the device pixel ratio multiplied by the zoom level (Read [more about devicePixelRatio](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/07/more_about_devi.html) at QuirksMode)\n\n```html\n<script src=\"detect-zoom.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  var zoom = detectZoom.zoom();\n  var device = detectZoom.device();\n\n  console.log(zoom, device);\n</script>\n```\n\n**AMD Usage**\n\n```javascript\nrequire(['detect-zoom'], function(detectZoom){\n    var zoom = detectZoom.zoom();\n});\n```\n\nChangelog\n------\n\n2013/3/29\n* Added package.json (thanks [@TCampaigne](https://github.com/TCampaigne))\n* Some documentation fixes\n\n2013/2/25\n* Fixed a missing 'else' between ie8 and ie10 detection\n* Minor version bump to 1.0.2\n\n2013/2/15\n* Added a fix for IE10 Metro (or whatever MS calls it these days..) by [@stefanvanburen](https://github.com/stefanvanburen)\n* Minor version bump to 1.0.1\n* Added minimized version\n\n2013/2/05\n* Merged a pull request that fixed zoom on IE being returned X100 (thanks [@kreymerman](https://github.com/kreymerman))\n* Refactored the code some more, changed some function names\n* Browser dependent main function is created only on initialization (thanks [@jsmaker](https://github.com/jsmaker))\n* _Open Issue: Firefox returns `zoom` and `devicePixelRatio` the same. Still looking for a solution here._\n* Started versioning - this is version 1.0.0\n\n2013/1/27\n* Added a fix to Mozilla's (Broken as I see it - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=809788)\nimplementation of window.devicePixel starting Firefox 18\n\n2013/1/26\n* Repository moved here\n* Refactored most of the code\n* Removed support for older browsers\n* Added support for AMD and CommonJS\n\n\nHelp Needed\n------\n\n***Detect-zoom is not complete, many parts of the code are 6 to 12 months old and I'm still reviewing them\nI need help testing different browsers, finding better ways to measure zoom on problematic browsers (ahm.. Firefox.. ahm)\npatches are more than welcome.***\n\n\nLicense\n------\n\nDetect-zoom is dual-licensed under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/) and [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license, at the recipient's choice.\n",
